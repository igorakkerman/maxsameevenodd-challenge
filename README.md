# Max Same Even and Odd

### Task
In an array _a_, 
find the largest slice with same values at even and odd indices, 
respectively.
That is, for all indices in that slice _i, j_ with _j = i+2_ 
the property _a[j] = a[i]_ should be satisfied.

### Examples
#### Example 1

_a = [1, 2, 3]_  
_result = 2_

#### Example 2
_a = [1, 2, 1]_  
_result = 3_

#### Example 3
_a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3]_  
_result = 3_

#### Example 4
_a = [3, 2, -1, 2, -1, 3, -1, 3]_  
_result = 4_

### Note
This is my very first [Go](https://golang.org) program
and you might tell from the code. I'm grateful for any advice.
